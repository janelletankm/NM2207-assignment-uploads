I'm Janelle, currently a year 2 Psychology major with a minor in CNM, and this is me!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](self-photo.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs a student navigating through the ups and downs of University life, I thought it'd be good to expose myself to different things here and there to build up some resilience, including coding! This website is hence meant as a final project for the module NM2207, where I showcase my grit in the world of code by doing up a data story on Health, namely, Alcohol abuse and its Public Health Consequences in the Americas.\\\n\nI hope you enjoy your (short) journey throughout my website!\n",
