I thought it'd be interesting to be able to pick up some coding skills, so here I am in NM2207! Though it's proving to be rather painful, I've come to enjoy seeing unintelligible lines of code manifest in the form of exciting visuals.

My initial decision to enroll in this module stemmed from my interest in UX/UI design. I was itching to know what goes on behind the scenes of every website, and I really wanted to be able to create a website I could call my own.

In essence, as tacky as it sounds, I just wanted a taste of what it's like as a *stem-girly*.

Final thoughts:

It tastes *so frustratingly* bitter-sweet, but sweet nonetheless.
