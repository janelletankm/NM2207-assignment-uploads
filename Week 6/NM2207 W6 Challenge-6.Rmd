## Questions
<br>

#### Question-1: Countdown Blastoff (While Loop)

Create a program that simulates a rocket launch countdown using a while loop. Start from 10 and countdown to "Blastoff!" with a one-second delay between each countdown number. Print a message when the rocket launches.

**Hint:** You may want to use `cat` command to print the countdown and `Sys.sleep` for incorporating the delay

**Output preview:** Here is how the countdown could look like 



**Solutions:**

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
countdown <- 10

while (countdown > 0) {
  cat("T-minus", countdown, "\n")
  Sys.sleep(1)  # Sleep for 1 second
  countdown <- countdown - 1
}

cat("Blastoff!\n")

```

#### Question-2: Word Reverser (for Loop)

Develop a program that takes a user-entered word and uses a while loop to print the word's characters in reverse order. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Hint:** You may want to use `substr` command to access each character of the input word, and `paste` command to join the reversed letters one at a time

**Solutions:** 

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
# Get user input
word <- "hello"

# Initialize an index variable to the length of the word
index <- nchar(word)

# Initialize an empty string to store the reversed word
reversed_word <- ""

# Use a while loop to reverse the word
while (index > 0) {
  # Extract a single character from the word using substr
  char <- substr(word, index, index)
  
  # Concatenate the character to the reversed_word
  reversed_word <- paste(reversed_word, char, sep = "")
  
  # Decrement the index
  index <- index - 1
}

# Print the reversed word
cat("Reversed word:", reversed_word, "\n")

```
