## Me! 

Hello, nice to meet you, and welcome to my page! I'm Janelle, currently a year 2 Psychology major with a minor in CNM, and this is me!

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("self-photo.png")
```

As a student navigating through the ups and downs of University life, I thought it'd be good to expose myself to different things here and there to build up some resilience, including coding! This website is hence meant as a final project for the module NM2207, where I showcase my grit in the world of code by doing up a data story on Health, namely, Alcohol abuse and its Public Health Consequences in the Americas.\

I hope you enjoy your (short) journey throughout my website!
